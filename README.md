# PRJ301_Assignment

- Make sure that folder "/build/web" is correctly placed inside folder "/build"
- Many features are incomplete, which should be ignored:
	- Searching and filtering by Restaurant/City
	- Order status (placed, completed, cancelled etc.)
	- Multiple database controls for different tables (only a few have been implemented as examples)
- Front-end was not the main focus
